/// very convenient access in some basic cases.
///
/// This allows you to use nicer syntax for some common operations.
/// For instance this code:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # fn do_something() -> redis::RedisResult<()> {
/// let client = redis::Client::open("redis://127.0.0.1/")?;
/// let mut con = client.get_connection()?;
/// redis::cmd("SET").arg("my_key").arg(42).execute(&mut con);
/// assert_eq!(redis::cmd("GET").arg("my_key").query(&mut con), Ok(42));
/// # Ok(()) }
/// ```
///
/// Will become this:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # fn do_something() -> redis::RedisResult<()> {
/// use redis::Commands;
/// let client = redis::Client::open("redis://127.0.0.1/")?;
/// let mut con = client.get_connection()?;
/// con.set("my_key", 42)?;
